// This is Michael's model of an Archimedes screw, resized and slightly modified in order to fit with the spiral ramp that the 
// ball will roll down. We plan to print it first, in order to test the workability of using an archimedes screw in order to 
// raise the ball to the top of our ramp, allowing the RGB machine to cycle indefinitely. The RGB is modular, with the screw 
// and the ramp fitting together, but printed seperately. Once the screw has been tested, the rest of the model is ready to 
// print,on the same scale as the screw. In this model, the screw and its exterior casing are printed speperately as well, in 
// order to allow for the removal of support structures after printing. They will fit together once printed. 

module screw(xsc, ysc, zsc) {
    translate([xsc, ysc, zsc])  //positions screw

        for ( z = [1:1080]) {   // screw rotates 1080 degrees about center
            color("green") rotate(z*7) translate([0,0,z*.27]) rotate([45,0,0]) cube(size = [28,2.5,4], center = false);
